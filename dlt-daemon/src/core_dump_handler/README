To build use cmake with -DWITH_DLT_COREDUMPHANDLER=ON -DTARGET_CPU_NAME={i686|x86_64}


Temporary replacement of default crash handler:
If you don't want to make the change persistent just become root (not sudo) and execute the following ("man core" for details):
echo "|/usr/local/bin/dlt-cdh %t %p %s %e" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern (replace /usr/local/bin with the path dlt-cdh has
been installed to)


Persistent replacement of default crash handler:
We have to generate "50-coredump.conf" in "/usr/lib/sysctl.d/" which is done automatically by "make install".
Unfortunately at least on Fedora systems we also have to remove abrt with "yum remove abrtd*" because this ruthlessly overwrites
our change at every boot. This must be done when installing this stuff as Debian package.
To enable the core dump handler without rebooting we have to execute "sysctl -p /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-coredump.conf"
